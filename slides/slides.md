# Why should we write tests?

# Why should we write tests?

- Manual testing is time consuming and prone to human error.
- We can run automated tests as many times as we want.
- Tests can help find and fix bugs before they are shipped to the users.
- It's easy to break things. A good test suite makes it easier to refactor application, as tests will help to detect any regressions.
- Tests can serve as a code documentation.

# Test types

- Unit
- Integration
- Functional
- End to End
- Performance
- Acceptance
- Accessibility
- Stress
- Smoke

# Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library

# Unit Testing Tips

- Test components in isolation.
- Mock API requests and any side-effects.
- Avoid shallow mounting - the speed trade-off just isn't worth it.
- Query elements just like a user would. Don't query by classes or ids. Tests should not be another consumer of your application.
- Avoid testing implementation details.
- Don't test third-party libraries.

# E2E tests with Cypress and Cypress Testing Library

# E2E Testing Tips

- Avoid mocking API requests. E2E tests should test whether client and server work together in cohesion.
- 100% coverage shouldn't always be a must. Otherwise, you might start testing implementation details or try to test for near-impossible scenarios.
- Don't test happy paths only. Test *Pending*, *Error* and *Empty states* too.
- Re-use authentication logic to speed up your tests.

# Summary

- Automated tests can save a lot of time and reduce likeliness of shipping buggy software.
- Setup a CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs tests.
- You can also run tests automatically locally with Husky.
- Mock API requests in unit but not e2e tests.
- Tests should be maintained just like the production code.
